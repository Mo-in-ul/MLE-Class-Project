Project Name: Predicting Dengue Fever Dynamics: Integrating Meteorological Factors with Time Series Machine Learning

Description: This project leverages machine learning and statistical modeling to understand and predict the impact of climate change
on the spread of dengue fever, a pressing global health concern. Utilizing data from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS)
for confirmed dengue cases across Bangladesh from January 2000 to December 2023, and meteorological data from NASA, we aim to analyze 
the relationship between weather patterns and disease outbreaks. The study employs a variety of models, including Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES),
Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), Generalized Additive Model (GA), and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM),
with a focus on forecasting dengue cases over a 30-day period. The SES model acts as a baseline for comparison. This approach not only aids in 
identifying high-risk areas but also in informing policy decisions on vector control and healthcare resource allocation, ultimately contributing
to proactive public health measures.
